Loading PreQ

```{r}
PreQ <- read.csv("Pre-quest-unique.csv")
```


```{r}
install.packages("ltm")
install.packages("mirt")
```

```{r}
library(ltm)
library(mirt)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
Pre_CC <- select (PreQ, ID, Q7:Q24)
```


```{r}
write.csv(Pre_CC, "Pre-CC.csv")
```

#Dichotomus version of the model (2PL)

Note: the data has been coded in excel, where 0 was assigned to the wrong answers and 1 to the correct ones. Questions that have the not sure option were excluded in this run to test the code first, then a 3PL will be tested later.

```{r}
Pre_CC_Coded <- read.csv("Pre-CC_coded.csv") #loading the coded file 
```

selecting the dichotomous questions only (disregarding not sure ones)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
Pre_CC_Q <- select(.data = Pre_CC_Coded,Q8,Q11:Q13, Q15:Q19, Q24)
```
