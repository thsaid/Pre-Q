```{r}
PreQ <- read.csv("PreQ_filtered.csv")
```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
Selecting  the coloumns in PALS

```{r}
PALS <- select(PreQ,ID,Gender,Certificate, Q27_1:Q27_15)
```

Now I am going to arrange the PALS reponses in long format (check with Michelle if what I got looks correct)

```{r}
PALS_long <- pivot_longer(data = PALS,cols =Q27_1:Q27_15,names_to = "Question",values_to = "Response"  )
```

Loading scores template

```{r}
PALS_scores <- read.csv("Scoring_PALS.csv")
```


Joining the two tables to calculate scores

```{r}
PALS_joined <- inner_join (x = PALS_long,y= PALS_scores, by = "ID")
```
